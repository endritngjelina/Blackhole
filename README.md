# Blackhole

An iterative front‑end mini‑project exploring a “Blackhole” concept.  
The repository contains three standalone versions built only with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—each one refining the last.

> **Friendly note:** Although this project is MIT‑licensed, please **ask for permission before reuse**. Thanks!


## Goals per version

- **v1:** Establish the layout and core idea with minimal styles and vanilla JS.
- **v2:** Refactor markup/CSS, add more deliberate visual hierarchy and small interactions.
- **v3:** Improve responsiveness, animation smoothness, accessibility (labels/contrast/tab flow), and basic performance (lighter DOM/CSS where possible).

## Tech stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** (flex/grid, transitions/animations) for presentation  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity (no dependencies)

## Running locally

No build step required.

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open any of the HTML files directly in your browser:
   - `blackhole 1.html`
   - `blackhole 2.html`
   - `blackhole 3.html`

> Tip: To avoid CORS quirks in some browsers, you can serve the folder:
> - Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000`
> - Node (http-server): `npx http-server -p 8000`

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Put the version you want to showcase at the repo root (e.g., rename `blackhole 3.html` to `index.html`).
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set the source to the `main` branch `/ (root)`.
3. Save and open the Pages URL.
